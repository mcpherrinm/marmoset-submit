Marmoset is an automated testing and marking environment used by some Waterloo
CS classes.

Installation
perl Makefile.PL
make
make install

Alternatively, just copy script/marmosetsubmit into your PATH and manually install
the required perl modules: WWW::Mechanize, IO::Prompt, LWP::Protocol::https, Mozilla::CA

This is a Perl script to automate submission to it via the command line,
including doing the CAS authentication.

Usage is simple:
marmosetsubmit CS444 A1 handin.zip

If your local system username does not match that on Marmoset, you should
change the environment variable USER, like so:
USER=mimcpher marmosetsubmit CS444 A1 handin.zip

Your password will be prompted for interactively.

Tested and working on both Linux and OS X.
