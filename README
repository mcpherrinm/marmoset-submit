Marmoset is an automated testing and marking environment used by some Waterloo
CS classes.  This is a Perl script to automate submission to it via the command
line, including doing the CAS authentication.  It is fairly specific to
Waterloo's instance of Marmoset.

Installation:
  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make install

Alternatively, just copy script/marmosetsubmit into your PATH and manually
install the required perl modules:
  WWW::Mechanize, IO::Prompt, LWP::Protocol::https, Mozilla::CA


Usage is simple:
  marmosetsubmit CS444 A1 handin.zip

If your local system username does not match that on Marmoset, you should
change the environment variable USER, like so:
  USER=mimcpher marmosetsubmit CS444 A1 handin.zip

Your password will be prompted for interactively.

Tested and working on both Linux and OS X.  If it does not work for you, please
save the HTML pages of your Marmoset session and attach them to a bug report.
Notably, I haven't tested if you're enrolled in more than one class.
