Marmoset is an automated testing and marking environment used by some Waterloo
CS classes.

This is a Perl script to automate submission to it via the command line,
including doing the CAS authentication.

Usage is simple:
marmoset-submit.pl CS444 A1 handin.zip

If your local system username does not match that on Marmoset, you should
change the environment variable USER, like so:
USER=mimcpher marmoset-submit.pl CS444 A1 handin.zip

Your password will be prompted for interactively.
